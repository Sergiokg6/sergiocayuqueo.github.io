## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security very seriously and strive to maintain a safe and secure environment for all users. If you believe you’ve discovered a security vulnerability in my project, I encourage you to report it directly and responsibly.

### Steps to Report a Vulnerability

1. **Contact Me Securely**  
   Please send a detailed vulnerability report to [sergiocayuqueo4@gmail.com](mailto:sergiocayuqueo4@gmail.com). The report should include:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The specific version of the project affected.
   - Any relevant screenshots, logs, or additional context that can help in investigating the issue.

2. **Response Time and Acknowledgement**  
   I will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours**. I will provide an initial assessment, including any additional information needed for investigation, as well as a timeframe for patching (if applicable).

3. **What to Expect Next**  
   - **Vulnerability Confirmed**: If I confirm the vulnerability, I will prioritize releasing a fix. You will receive updates on the status of the patch, and I will notify you when the fix is live.
   - **Vulnerability Not Accepted**: If the report does not meet the criteria for being a security issue (e.g., false positives or out of scope), I will provide a clear explanation of why the vulnerability was not accepted.

4. **Public Disclosure**  
   Once the vulnerability is resolved and the fix is released, I will publish details about the issue and its resolution on my website or in a relevant update to keep the community informed and promote best practices.

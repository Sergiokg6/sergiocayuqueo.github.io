                Sales Principles I have found so far. <br><br><br>
                <b>1. Immutable Principles </b><br><br>
                1.1 Sales = Deep Listening <br>
                Actively listen to your prospects to understand their needs and concerns.<br>
                Assume the best intentions if they don’t respond immediately. Follow up respectfully but persistently until you get a definitive "no." <br> <br>
                1.2 The Power of Persistence <br>
                Sales require an inhumane level of willingness to follow through. <br>
                Thoughtful and personalized emails are never a waste of time. They build rapport and demonstrate genuine interest. <br>
                A 'no' can often be a blessing in disguise, guiding you to refine your approach or product.<br> <br>
                1.3 It's Not Over Until It's Over<br>
                Keep the dialogue alive until a decision is made. Selling is a journey, not a single event.<br><br>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <b>2. Closing the Sale </b> <br><br>
                2.1 Early-Stage Sales Philosophy<br>
                Focus on validation, commitment, and revenue. Avoid falling into the "free trial trap," which rarely brings meaningful validation or commitment.<br><br>
                2.2 Make It Fun and Energetic<br>
                Sales are the most exhilarating phase of a company’s journey. Each conversation is a learning opportunity and fuels momentum.<br><br>
                2.3 Measure Engagement to Predict Outcomes<br>
                Tools like Uber Conference can provide insights. For example, receiving feedback on talk time (how much you spoke vs. your prospect) can indicate the likelihood of closing a deal.<br><br>
                2.4 Product-Market Fit<br>
                Yesses are your signal of product-market fit. If you’re not getting them, reevaluate your product or pitch.<br><br>
                2.5 Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Sales<br>
                Like in computer science, explore a wide range of prospects (big and small) quickly. A small sale is better than none, and speed is critical in early stages.<br>
                Don’t obsess over "logos" (prestigious prospects). Momentum matters more.<br><br>
                2.6 Pricing Strategy<br>
                Always believe in the price you set. If a customer buys at X, consider raising the price for the next customer to 2X. Iterate quickly to find the sweet spot.<br><br>

                <br>
                <b>3. Mutable Principles</b><br><br>
                3.1 AI Hype is Not a Crutch<br>
                For now if you can’t sell your product without mentioning "AI," you likely don’t have a sustainable value proposition.<br><br>
                3.2 Selling is Who You Are<br>
                Sales aren’t about perfect lines or scripts; they reflect your authenticity, persistence, and adaptability.<br><br>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <b> 4. The Content Connection</b><br><br>
                4.1 Sales as a Multi-Touch Journey<br>
                Selling is more than phone calls—it’s about every interaction prospects have with your brand.<br>
                Repurpose your sales pitch into blog posts, landing pages, YouTube videos, podcast discussions, and social media content.<br><br>
                4.2 Pre-Sell and Qualify<br>
                Ensure prospects encounter your content before speaking with you. This pre-qualifies them and reinforces your value proposition.<br><br>
                4.3 Reinforce After the Call<br>
                Continue sharing valuable content post-call to solidify your position and keep your brand top-of-mind.<br><br><br>
